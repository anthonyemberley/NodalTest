Main

Basic Launch:
Launch website with index.html. Easy

Full Launch:
> The support tab has functionality to actually submit a form. Currently it is configured to send to my gmail, but we'll prob change it to some support@nodal.co.
> But to send emails you need to be able to run php scripts so you need to go through a local server

If Windows: Download WAMP. Launch WAMP and then open the site through WAMP. The rest I am not sure of as I used a Mac. Read the rest of the Mac directions; they will likely be similar.

If Mac: Download MAMP. Launch MAMP. Go to preferences and set root folder and NodalWebApp/Main. Then start servers. Then click open webstart page. This wil take you to an intermediate MAMP webpage. In the header it says "My Website". Click on that and it will go to index.html in Main. Once this is set up the support.html will properly submit the form.
